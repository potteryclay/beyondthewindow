                <td style="text-align: left;"><p>&emsp;The metaphor for viewing source code I wrote at the beginning of the semester 
                    was “looking beyond the window.” While windows in real life are typically looked 
                    through to what happens behind them, a browser window is typically looked at, 
                    often at face-value. In constructing this metaphor, I used the double entendre of 
                    looking through a window to view what is beyond, but also looking beyond the 
                    browser window in the sense of looking at the website’s source code. Although I 
                    have learned a lot during this course, I believe the metaphor I constructed still 
                    holds up. While it still communicates the same meaning now of looking beyond the 
                    appearance of the window to what it is built with, I had used window more 
                    generally than a webpage. A window is the tool through which we would view a 
                    website and viewing the source code of a website is not the same as the source 
                    code of the browser itself. At the start of this course, my go-to for exploring 
                    HTML was to view source code on <a href="https://coryarcangel.com/" target="_blank">Cory Arcangel’s website</a> 
                    and my friend <a href="https://unplugtheinter.net/" target="_blank">Ellie Young’s website.</a> 
                    Throughout this course, and the addition of CSS to my knowledge, I began to view 
                    source code on more complex webpages like some of my 
                    favorite <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/" target="_blank">"useless websites.”</a>
                    <br>&emsp;Beyond the semantics of the metaphor, it is an important idea to consider. Many 
                    people do not question the websites they view every day, yet all media has been 
                    constructed somehow by someone. And as a product of this, their beliefs and messages 
                    have been imbued in the media and we must understand what we are being fed so we can 
                    make our own conclusions. There is a reason for everything that is communicated, and 
                    understanding this background can help us communicate, understand, and interpret our 
                    world better. Beyond just media, transparency allows us to consume products in a way 
                    that suits the persons needs and desires, not just what they have been told.
